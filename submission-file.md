## Introduction to Application

Luggo is a smart luggage tracking application designed to enhance travelers' experience by providing real-time location tracking and weight monitoring of their luggage. The app combines Bluetooth connectivity with GPS technology to offer precise location tracking and integrates with weight sensors to help users avoid excess baggage fees.

The application features three main components: a home dashboard providing quick access to essential functions, a weight monitoring system that allows users to set custom weight limits and receive alerts when exceeded, and a real-time tracking interface utilizing Google Maps for precise luggage location visualization.

The application incorporates comprehensive features including real-time GPS tracking with Google Maps integration and Bluetooth connectivity for GPS module communication. Users can set and monitor custom weight limits with visual indicators and interact with an intuitive map interface that displays distance information. The emergency luggage locator function includes a sound alert system to help users quickly locate their belongings. The app also implements persistent storage for user preferences, ensuring settings are maintained between sessions.

The app is built using Flutter for cross-platform compatibility on iOS and Android, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices. It employs various hardware sensors through a Bluetooth connection, making it a practical solution for travelers concerned about luggage security and airline weight restrictions. The modern, intuitive user interface follows material design principles, providing a seamless and engaging experience for users of all technical backgrounds.
